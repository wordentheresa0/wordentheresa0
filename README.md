### About Me

Hi! I'm Theresa Worden, a current junior Computer Science and Math major at St. Olaf College (graduating December 2024) with a passion for all things tech. I'm aspiring to work in a software development position in the future. In the past, I have worked at Best Buy as a Software Engineer Intern.
